            <h4>Online Surveys</h4>
            <p>Zaara Travels values opinions and comments from members, so we frequently conduct online surveys.
                Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated, and used to
                make improvements to the Website and its services and to develop appealing content, features and promotions
                for Website members. Survey participants are unidentified unless otherwise stated in the survey.</p>

            <p>Zaara Travels frequently sponsors promotions and draws to give Website members the opportunity to win great
                travel and travel - related prizes. Information collected by us for such activities may include contact
                information and survey questions. We use contact information to notify contest winners and survey
                information to develop promotions and product improvements to the Website.</p>


            <h4>Automatic Logging of Session Data</h4>
            <p>We automatically log generic information about your computer connection to the Internet, which we call
                "session data", that is anonymous and not linked to any Personal Information. Session data consists of
                things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities
                conducted by the user while on the Website. An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the
                internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the
                Website the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us analyse such things as what
                items visitors are likely to click on most, the way visitors are clicking through the Website, how many
                visitors are surfing to various pages on the Website, how long visitors to the Website are staying and how
                often they are visiting. It also helps us diagnose problems with our servers and lets us better administer
                our systems. Although such information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine
                from an IP address a visitor</p>

            <p>Internet Service Provider (ISP), and the approximate geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
